<h3>American Psycho</h3>

<p>American Psycho is a compelling film that is filled with the extreme horrors of what American capitalism has to offer.</p>

<h3>Good Fellas</h3>

<p> I mean, it's Good Fellas.. Come on</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>

<p> The Dark Knight is a beautifully captured film by the great Christopher Nolan. 
    The Dark Knight emerges from the darkness to be the savior of a population that 
    doesn't understand his importance until chaos erupts. 
    The Dark Knight is simply the fine balancing of the restoration of order when chaos occurs.</p>
